# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: Thursday, November 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** Started the freeCodeCampResponsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) course as my challenge for 100 days of code. Made it about halfway through the first topic, Basic HTML and HTML5. I also worked my way through a few modules of Gordon Zhu's watchandcode.com Practical Javascript course. My goal is to do an hour of day of both and today I've completed Day 1 out of 100.

### R1D3: Saturday, November 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
