# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: Thursday, November 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) course as my challenge for 100 days of code. Made it about halfway through the first topic, Basic HTML and HTML5. I also worked my way through a few modules of Gordon Zhu's watchandcode.com Practical Javascript course. Today I've completed Day 1 out of 100.

**Thoughts**: Let's see how this goes.

### R1D2: Friday, November 16th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: In the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification, completed the first topic, Basic HTML and HTML5 and started on an introduction to CSS- Cascading Style Sheets. 

**Thoughts**: It's much easier to get into a state of flow coding when I have some non-lyrical music playing in the background. Finally finished my 1 hour of the day and interesting to see how I broke it out into 3 chunks of time - 7 min 28 sec, 16 min 52 sec, and 24 min 22 sec. 

### R1D3: Saturday, November 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
